## Potato Pirates Leaderboard

This is a little app I put together to practice what I'd learned over the first few weeks at CodeClan.

We've been playing a great little game called [Potato Pirates](https://www.potatopirates.game/) and I thought it would be a good idea to track the winners of each game over the duration of the course.

It's a work in progress but for now it uses a couple of classes, a postgres database and a simple console app to show the leaderboard.
